<p id="parone">So far my experience with coding has been a big journey. Its funny how all things happen at once. Decided to face past traumas, and lined up with my coding classes. School, without going into to much detail, has had a very negative place in my life. Even when I get outdoor certifications, or kayak teaching liscenes, even though its is something i love and doesnt even involve a class room, i have a had a really tough time succeeding and feeling comfortable. I have been peeling back layers and healing and growing, this really started 2 years ago. Coding is the next catalyst to healing and improving my life. I have also really struggled to sleep. I am noticing the change taking place. I allowed external factors outside the challenges of the bootcamp effect my performance. I have gained more trust in myself as i face adversity i stick to my commitments and try my best. I have made more sacrifices in my personal life then i have ever been willing to before. If i knew how to focus my intention in the past in the way coding is requiring me to, i may have found more success in my life thus far. The funny part is I expect it to feel good. When i was always putting fun, and friends, and experience first. a part of me felt really bad the entire time, hence why the partying and extreme sports can get over my head. It doesnt all feel good though. It feels good to accomplish, and over come, but being as short sided as i am its hard. I have neglected new friends, not having extra time or finances impacts my relationship, i have had to give up experience most people dont even have the oppurtunity to be apart of, im not in as good of shape, i dont keep my boating skills as sharp, and i walked away from a job that fills me up and gives me purpose(but only 3months out of the year). In order to achieve stability you have to level the ground, that requires some digging. The focus and direction feels good, I first discovered that with kayaking. Everything about the job and the hobby fills me up. It took me by surprise what people where getting from my lessons. For an example one of my most impactful moments, is when a middle aged woman came up to me crying at the end of the class. She asked if she could hug me, after the hug she shared some very challenging things she had been trying to over come. She told me she now believes she going home with more strength, more confidence, and a clearer perspective on what is real fear, and imposed. She could face the real fear, any one else in her life imposing fear no longer had power. It’s hard once you relize this because it now becomes your responsibility to grow. Once you take away the power external factors have over you, and you have some confidence and can see immediate bravery, courage, success. This allows us to re write our subconscious narrative. Kayaking has had a similar effect on me. I get to see first hand with immediate (sometimes very scary) consequences. They are immediate, i chased kayaking because i believe you have to leave comfort zones to grow and heal. After all the immediate success, skills increase, body muscles, the close calls that would have gone different if i hadnt reacted exactly how i had. I know no what success feels like, looks like. Despite it always being scary, i have grown comfortable with pushing my comfort zone in that area. The more you push and push, the more you find what works, you learn when the right time to push further is. You learn how and when to push. Now if only i could find something worth applying this logic too that was a delayed response? With results that will allow me to create stability in my life. Pushing comfort zones.

<p id="ponetwo">Despite me struggling to keep up, and catch up, and some severe insomnia holding me back. I would not change anything. I think the reason i was able to have such an impact on the woman in my story, is because i had experienced similar struggles in my own life. If i didnt have those struggles, I wouldnt have know how to get through to her, before hearing her past. I wouldnt be able to change the way the little adhd boys feel about themselves when they start out isolated from the group, when they leave my classes the little cazy bastards that usual get rejected by the outher instructors and their peers, usually leave my class holding some leadership role in the group. With out struggles, you cant over come, you cant learn, you cant empathize on a level that doesnt need to be spoken, and you cant give what some one needs.

<p id="pthree">Document object model. Everything to a computer is an object. The visual representation used in class, has been my preferred method of wirframing my code. Seeing how everything connects, what draws from what, what is actually contained in that object, how that object works when we give it a command, where it has to go to get that information. It is all about req/res. Using the visual model has really helped me get a grasp on the over all workings, and the immediate workings. Just another fractal!</p>

Coding in my mind takes different forms at different times. Hard to explain. I gues i would say in my mind, i see it as a system, and i feel the logic and patterns, and it manifests differently on different projects. Patterns have multiple forms but can be totally different. The way a shell forms, and the way musical harmonics work are to extremely different things. The blueprint is the same. I suppose that is how i think about it, but i dont really control what my mind turns the understanding or goal into. Kind of a trippy question. Its kind of like how most the things we find beautiful, or triggers anger, or any other human experience that triggers some sort of reactive response emotionally can be traced back to number patterns if broken down into data. We just take the data and create the experience.

<p id="pfive">I see myself working in a home where i dont have a dresser as a desk, an entry way that isnt an acting gear shed, the the same woman by myside. Im not sure what i would like to be working on. I like solving problems, i like to make people feel good. Not sure what avenue is available to have those things. It is not that important what i do, as long as i am not miserable. I have such a full life, not being held back by financial burdens, while working less hours, and making more money, I have the rest of my time to impact people. First rule of rescue, “your number one, if you dont help yourself first, you cant help any one else, you actually compromise the situation further.” so i am going to work hard and create stability. I am trusting where this leads and for me to make right choices for myself to create a balanced life. </p>
